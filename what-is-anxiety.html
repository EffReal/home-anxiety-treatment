<h3 style="color:blue;"><strong>What Is Anxiety?</strong></h3>
  
 
<p>The term anxiety is a generic term that can cover a broad range of common anxiety disorders which include generalized anxiety disorder, 
panic disorder, social anxiety disorder and agoraphobia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). 
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common of the “anxieties” with typical symptoms comprising persistent, disproportionate 
worry which the person finds difficult to control with the worry usually over commonplace events and activities.</p>

<p>We all worry about normal life events such as work stresses, personal relationships, finances or health, and such worry doesn’t normally
prevent us functioning. However, people with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) find that their worry becomes extreme, hard to get under
control and it starts to invade all aspects of their lives. Such people typically worry more about something than most others do and 
have a tendency to blow things out of proportion.  If GAD is left untreated it often results in severe emotional stress while damaging 
  work, family and social functioning and potentially impacting physical health.</p>

<p>Females are statistically more likely than males to develop GAD and it’s a sad fact that in the USA, less than 40% of people 
  suffering anxiety will seek treatment and of those, many will fail to manage anxiety to their satisfaction or, if they do, it 
  returns at the next obstacle life puts in their way.</p>

<p>Given that over 18% of the US population (40 million people over 18) will experience anxiety each year and in the UK more than 
  1 in 10 people are likely to have a ‘disabling anxiety disorder’ at some stage in their life is it any wonder that controlling 
  and relieving anxiety has become center stage in internet forums around the world.</p>

<p>Generalised anxiety disorder is one of the most common diagnoses by clinicians. The age range at which GAD can begin is quite 
  broad, ranging from twenty to forty years of age, but most people diagnosed with GAD report that they have always been worriers 
  and that the worrying is only now becoming a handicap.</p>

<p>GAD tends to develop slowly over time and fluctuate in severity.  Although most people appear to experience the symptoms constantly 
  once they have GAD, about one-quarter of people do exhibit periods of remission (three months or longer without symptoms).
There are various reasons for the development and maintenance of GAD. The inability of individuals to deal with uncertainty about the future has 
  been identified as one of the core issues. The role of “fear of the fear,” in which people believe that their anxiety is uncontrollable
  or dangerous, is also a key issue.</p>

<p><strong>Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder include the following:</strong></p>
<p>Excessive worrying that goes on for months</p>
<p>Insomnia or broken sleep;</p>
<p>Feeling very tense or having chronic muscular pain;</p>
<p>Difficulty in concentrating, easily distracted, forgetful;</p>
<p>Feeling tired or becoming easily fatigued;</p>
<p>Irritability;</p>
<p>Over thinking and over planning;</p>
<p>Feeling on edge or restless;</p>
<p>A feeling of unreality – feeling spaced out;</p>
<p>Excessive list making;</p>
<p>Seeking constant reassurance from people.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>There are three main methods of managing anxiety:</strong></p>
<p><i>Education</i></p>
<p>Understanding what is happening to you and why it is happening can provide an immediate improvement in symptoms. Learning that 
  you have nothing to fear from anxiety and that it can be de-conditioned is a huge relief for many who believe that anxiety is 
  uncontrollable. Avoidance and repression will only worsen anxiety symptoms while facing up to anxiety is the first step in 
  developing a successful and balanced wellness plan.</p>

<p><i>Therapy</i></p>
<p>There are many different therapies that show improvement in anxiety symptoms. Most programs of therapy include some cognitive 
  behavioral therapy (CBT) as a core and include other therapies that support mindfulness, relaxation, exercise, and bodywork.
For treatment to be successful people must learn and practice techniques to manage their anxiety while taking responsibility for 
  changing and controlling their thoughts, feelings, and behavior.</p>

<p><i>Medication</i></p>
<p>Medication for anxiety is similar to taking a painkiller for a headache; it provides temporary relief but doesn’t address the 
  underlying issue. Additionally, prolonged use of some of the medication is addictive and therefore should only be used in the 
  short-term. Your doctor can provide advice on anxiety medication.  Most people wishing to successfully manage their anxiety 
  prefer to use the medication for short-term relief only while they manage the anxiety through therapy.</p>
